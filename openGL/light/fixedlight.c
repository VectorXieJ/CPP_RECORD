 *  movelight.c
 *  This program demonstrates when to issue lighting and
 *  transformation commands to render a model with a light
 *  which is moved by a modeling transformation (rotate or
 *  translate).  The light position is reset after the modeling
 *  transformation is called.  The eye position does not change.
 *
 *  A sphere is drawn using a grey material characteristic.
 *  A single light source illuminates the object.
 *
 *  Interaction:  pressing the left mouse button alters
 *  the modeling transformation (x rotation) by 30 degrees.
 *  The scene is then redrawn with the light in a new position.
